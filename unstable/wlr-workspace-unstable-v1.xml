  <interface name="zwlr_workspace_manager_v1" version="1">
    <description summary="list and control workspaces">
      Workspaces, also called virtual desktops, are groups of surfaces. A
      compositor with a concept of workspaces may only show some such groups of
      surfaces (those of 'active' workspaces) at a time. 'Activating' a
      workspace is a request for the compositor to display that workspace's
      surfaces as normal, whereas the compositor may hide or otherwise
      de-emphasise surfaces that are associated only with 'inactive' workspaces.
      Workspaces are grouped by which sets of outputs they correspond to, and
      may contain surfaces only from those outputs. In this way, it is possible
      for each output to have its own set of workspaces, or for all outputs (or
      any other arbitrary grouping) to share workspaces. Compositors may
      optionally conceptually arrange each group of workspaces in an
      N-dimensional grid.

      The purpose of this protocol is to enable the creation of taskbars and
      docks by providing them with a list of workspaces and their properties,
      and allowing them to activate and deactivate workspaces.

      After a client binds the zwlr_workspace_manager_v1, each workspace will be
      sent via the workspace event.

        All initial details of the workspace group (workspaces, outputs) will be
        sent immediately after this event via the corresponding events in
        zwlr_workspace_group_handle_v1.

        the client should free any resources associated with it.

      A zwlr_workspace_group_handle_v1 object represents a a workspace group

      The set of outputs assigned to the workspace group is conveyed to the client via
      output_enter and output_leave events, and its workspaces are conveyed with
      workspace events.

        another sends an output_enter event and an output_leave event to the two
        zwlr_workspace_group_handle_v1 objects in question. The compositor sends
        both done events only after both other events.

    <description summary="a workspace handing a group of surfaces">
      A zwlr_workspace_handle_v1 object represents a a workspace that handles a
      group of surfaces.

      Each workspace has a name, conveyed to the client with the name event; a
      list of states, conveyed to the client with the state event; and
      optionally a set of coordinates, conveyed to the client with the

    <event name="coordinates">
      <description summary="workspace coordinates changed">
        This event is used to organize workspaces into an N-dimensional grid
        within a workspace group, and if supported, is emitted immediately after
        the zwlr_workspace_handle_v1 is created and whenever the coordinates of
        the workspace change. Compositors may not send this event if they do not
        conceptually arrange workspaces in this way. If compositors simply
        number workspaces, without any geometric interpretation, they may send
        1D coordinates, which clients should not interpret as implying any
        geometry.

        Coordinates have an arbitrary number of dimensions N with an uint32
        position along each dimension. By convention if N > 1, the first
        dimension is X, the second Y, the third Z, and so on. The compositor may
        chose to utilize these events for a more novel workspace layout
        convention, however. No guarantee is made about the grid being filled or
        bounded; there may be a workspace at coordinate 1 and another at
        coordinate 1000 and none in between. Within a workspace group, however,
        workspaces must have unique coordinates of equal dimensionality.

    <event name="state">
      <description summary="the state of the workspace changed">
        This event is emitted immediately after the zwlr_workspace_handle_v1 is
        created and each time the workspace state changes, either because of a
        compositor action or because of a request in this protocol.

    <event name="done">
      <description summary="all information about the workspace has been sent">
        This event is sent after all changes in the workspace state have been

        This allows changes to one or more zwlr_workspace_handle_v1 properties
        to be seen as atomic, even if they happen via multiple events. In
        particular, if a workspace changes its coordinates, coordinates events
        may be sent to multiple zwlr_workspace_handle_v1 objects as workspaces
        are reordered. The compositor sends the done events only after all
        coordinates events have been sent.

    <event name="remove">

        This event means the zwlr_workspace_handle_v1 has been destroyed. It is
        guaranteed there won't be any more events for this
        zwlr_workspace_handle_v1. The zwlr_workspace_handle_v1 becomes inert so
        any requests will be ignored except the destroy request.

    <request name="destroy" type="destructor">
      <description summary="destroy the zwlr_workspace_handle_v1 object">
        Destroys the zwlr_workspace_handle_v1 object.

        This request should be called either when the client does not want to
        use the workspace object any more or after the remove event to finalize
        the destruction of the object.
      </description>
    </request>

    <request name="activate">
      <description summary="activate the workspace">
        Request that this workspace be activated.

        There is no guarantee the workspace will be actually activated, and
        behaviour may be compositor-dependent. For example, activating a
        workspace may or may not deactivate all other workspaces in the same
        group.
      </description>
    </request>

    <request name="deactivate">
      <description summary="activate the workspace">
        Request that this workspace be deactivated.

        There is no guarantee the workspace will be actually deactivated.
      </description>
    </request>

    <request name="commit">
      <description summary="all requests about the workspace have been sent">
        The client must send this request after it has finished sending other
        requests. The compositor must process a series of requests preceding a
        commit request atomically. This includes requests on other
        zwlr_workspace_handle_v1 objects: if the client sends requests for
        multiple zwlr_workspace_handle_v1 objects, the compositor must wait
        until a commit request has been sent for every one of those
        zwlr_workspace_handle_v1 objects, and process all of the preceding
        requests atomically. 

        This allows changes to the workspace properties to be seen as atomic,
        even if they happen via multiple events, and even if they involve
        multiple zwlr_workspace_handle_v1 objects, for example, deactivating one
        workspace and activating another.
